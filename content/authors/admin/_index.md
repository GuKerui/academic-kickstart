I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and an exchange student in Nanyang Technological University currently. My interests broadly lie in Mechine Learning and Computer Vision, especially in neural network interpretability and 3D reconstruction.

Previously, I was working on a project about the interpretability of neural network supervised by Quanshi Zhang, Associate Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Currently, I am focused on a project about the combination of depth estimation, plane detection supervised by Guosheng Lin, Assistant Professor in Multimedia&Interactive Computing Lab(MICL) at Nanyang Technological University.
